TO RUN THE APP!!!

- Extract Zip
- In terminal in the project root run: npm install
  -If that doesnt work, run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  (This will allow the installation to continue by ignoring peer version mismatch.)
- Lastly run: npm run dev
- It should now be running on: http://localhost:3000
